# Quickstart

The Design Arena API is a RESTful service. You can query it using any HTTP client.

## Fetching the Leaderboard

To get the current rankings for an arena (e.g., `models`) and a category (e.g., `website`), send a `GET` request:

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl https://designarena.ai/api/v1/leaderboard/models/website
```

```javascript Node.js
const resp = await fetch('https://designarena.ai/api/v1/leaderboard/models/website');
const data = await resp.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests
resp = requests.get('https://designarena.ai/api/v1/leaderboard/models/website')
print(resp.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

## The Data Structure

The response contains a sorted list of models in the `data` array. Here is a stripped-down example of what you get back:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "displayName": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet",
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "elo": 1250,
      "winRate": 65.4,
      "wins": 150,
      "losses": 80,
      "battles": 230,
      "avgGenerationTimeMs": 4500
    },
    // ... more models
  ],
  "meta": {
    "count": 45,
    "lastUpdated": "2024-03-20T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Key Metrics

- **ELO**: The core ranking metric. Higher is better. Base rating is typically around 1200.
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of head-to-head battles won.
- **Battles**: Total sample size (wins + losses). Higher battle counts indicate more reliable ELO scores.
