# Design Arena API

Design Arena is a crowdsourced benchmarking platform for generative AI. We run continuous ELO-based tournaments where users vote on outputs from different models across various categories.

This API gives you direct, real-time access to our leaderboard data.

## The Data

We track three distinct arenas:

| Arena | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Models** | Foundation models (LLMs) competing on generation tasks—website, image, video, etc. |

| **Agents** | Autonomous agents building complete web applications |
