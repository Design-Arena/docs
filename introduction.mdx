# Design Arena API

Design Arena is a crowdsourced benchmarking platform for generative AI. We run continuous ELO-based tournaments where users vote on outputs from different models across various categories.

This API gives you direct, real-time access to our dataset.

## The Data

We track three distinct arenas:

1.  **Models Arena**: Foundation models (LLMs) competing on generation tasks (Text-to-Website, Text-to-Image, etc.).
2.  **Builders Arena**: AI-powered developer tools and IDEs.
3.  **Agents Arena**: Autonomous agents building complete web applications.

## Getting Started

The API is public and currently requires no authentication for read-only access.
